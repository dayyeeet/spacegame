# spacegame
A game that is focused around space travel and gathering resources on eerie planets. Get more and more scared as you upgrade your ship and advance even deeper into the dangerous outer space. Made for Unity Summer Game Jam 2024

## Coding on the game
We will create one scene for every one of us working on the game. Ideally, we all do something different. We can work on the same thing with other members too. Every feature gets a specific branch, which will be merged with
the approval of the Team.
