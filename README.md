# Uneasy Travel
You are stranded in space. Your only way to survive is to pick up flowers to restore your continuously decreasing fuel levels. But beware: Scary creatures are awaiting you...
A game that is focused around space travel and gathering resources on eerie planets. Get more and more scared as you upgrade your ship and advance even deeper into the dangerous outer space. Made for Unity Summer Game Jam 2024
